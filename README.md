# A Discord bot coded in Discord.JS, acting as a library assistant of Honkai Impact 3rd Game to help Discord user find some info about the game  

You may be heard about AI Chan bot before... and this project is do same thing but only act to show info about Hi3, I remove some unecessary feature from that bot.
What I want to tell you is hard to make the bot keep update with the game since there is so many new content in game but I just a mortal human that can't keep up with that
I decide to make it open source so everyone can make their own bot and help me update it

See the bot action on https://discord.gg/SJU2yjF

# Installation

This bot is written to run on top of node.js. Please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have node installed running `npm install` from the bot directory should install all the needed packages. If this command prints errors the bot won't work!
